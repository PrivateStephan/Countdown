                        | If you are starting with de ADSD in August of 2018, this is the place to be. We will be preparing
                        | you for the coding challenges that will be coming. We will start with some excercises for the
                        | HTML5 mind, then we will slide into CSS3 and will create the nicest layout. At the end we will bring
                        | interactivity to your coding skills with JavaScript.
